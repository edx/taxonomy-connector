Taxonomy
--------
The taxonomy service is a library that can be installed in other edX components
that provides access to third party taxonomy vendors. EMSI is currently the
only vendor available, but others may be integrated as necessary. This service
can communicate with the vendor to get job, skill, and salary data. This service
can also be used to submit data (course descriptions, etc.) to the vendor to
produce potential matches for a skill or job.

After submitting a pull request, please use the Github "Reviewers" widget to add
relevant reviewers and track review process.
